# Snake-with-Swing
simple implementation of Snake in Java with Swing and some advanced features

This project was originally created as a little personal project I would work on during my Java classes in uni to implement the things we learned in a real-world example

This GitHub project mainly exists so I have a reference when creating other Java Projects
